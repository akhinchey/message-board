### Notes:

I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project, and used it as an opportunity to learn some new things on-the-go, mainly react-router and Bootstrap components. Working with these new tools slowed my decision-making process down, but I'm glad I decided to use them as they definitely improved the user experience of the app.

Though the requirements were fairly short, I did my best to make the app as robust as possible for what it is. In a perfect world I would love to go back and focus on refactoring, more validations, and testing.
