### Notes:

I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project, and used it as an opportunity to learn some new things on-the-go, mainly react-router and Bootstrap components. Working with these new tools slowed my decision-making process down, but I'm glad I decided to use them as they definitely improved the user experience of the app.

Though the requirements were fairly short, I did my best to make the app as robust as possible for what it is. In a perfect world I would love to go back and focus on refactoring, adding more validations, and testing.

Quick Technical Overview:

- App bootsrapped with Create React App

To use, simply clone this repo, install the dependencies and run `$ yarn start`

#### Additional Notes:

To better follow the wireframes I added a default component for when there are no posts, but have kept the seed message data as-is. To verify that the app will show this messaging correctly, you can change `line 11` in `src/reducer.js` to:

```
    posts: []
```

Then clear your local storage in the 'Application' tab of DevTools.
